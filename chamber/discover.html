                Our beautiful little town covers 3 square miles in the heart of the rocky mountians. We
                currently have 20,000 people, more than 30 businesses, and 7,000 homes.

                This is the park in our little town. Often people will come here on the weekends to meet new friends,
                hold get togethers with family, and for town events like the 4th of July cook off.

                Here at the south end of our main street, we have some of our most loved attractions and 
                businesses. These include Anjolina's Cafe, Brian's Sporting Goods, and the movie theatre

                The old dance hall is used almost every night. It's often rented out to events like weddings,
                but every Friday and Saturday night a dance is held for the local youth.

                Billy Bob, our founder orriginally built this house 200 years ago for his family. Remarkably well
                preserved for its age, this home is a state landmark and is visited often by those who love history.

                Our beloved mayor, Jane Smith, lives at this home. She has served our community for the last
                10 years as our mayor and has done a fantastic job. Unlike most politicians she is loved by the 
                community she serves.
