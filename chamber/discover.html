            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Our town was founded in 1874 when Billy Bob built the first homestead here. Later as more houses were built
                conflict began to arise between the settlers and the indians. Eventually in 1886, the indians began to burn homesteads
                and steal cattle. The army was later that year called in to bring peace. After that, the town has been remarkably
                quiet.

            <h3>Fairview Park</h3>
            <p>
                This is the park in our little town. Often people will come here on the weekends to meet new friends,
                hold get togethers with family, and for town events like the 4th of July cook off.
